# Mini Project: 
# Automated Server Configuration

## Overview:
In this mini project, you will create a Python script that automates the configuration of a server. The script will install necessary packages, create users and groups, and configure firewall rules.

## Requirements:

1. The script should be able to be run on a fresh Ubuntu server.
2. The script should install the following packages: Nginx, PostgreSQL, Python3, and pip.
3. The script should create a new user and group for a Python application, and set appropriate permissions on directories and files.
4. The script should configure firewall rules to allow traffic to the server on ports 22, 80, and 5432.

### Optional:

5. The script can also set up a virtual environment for the Python application.
6. The script can also clone a Git repository containing the Python application and install its dependencies.

## Steps:

1. Install necessary packages: Nginx, PostgreSQL, Python3, and pip.
2. Create a new user and group for the Python application.
3. Set appropriate permissions on directories and files for the new user and group.
4. Configure firewall rules to allow traffic to the server on ports 22, 80, and 5432.

Optional: Set up a virtual environment for the Python application.

Optional: Clone a Git repository containing the Python application and install its dependencies.

You can test the script on a fresh Ubuntu server, and modify it as necessary to fit your specific needs. 

This project will give you practice in using Python to automate server configuration, which is a crucial skill for DevOps engineers.
