2. Write a program that takes in a list of numbers and removes any duplicates.
## Day 5: File I/O

1. Write a program that reads in a file and prints out the contents of the file.
2. Write a program that takes in a list of numbers and writes them to a file in CSV format.
## Day 6: Regular Expressions

1. Write a program that searches a text file for phone numbers and prints out any phone numbers found.
2. Write a program that searches a text file for email addresses and prints out any email addresses found.
## Day 7: Object-Oriented Programming

1. Create a class called "Car" that has attributes for make, model, and year.
2. Create a method within the class that prints out the car's make, model, and year.
## Day 8: Error Handling

1. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, but handles the error if the user enters something other than a number.
2. Write a program that reads in a file, but handles the error if the file is not found.
## Day 9: Testing and Debugging

1. Write a program and test it using the unittest module.
2. Use the pdb module to debug a program.
## Day 10: Virtual Environments

1. Create a virtual environment and install a package within it.
2. Activate the virtual environment and run a program that uses the package.
## Day 11: Package Management

1. Use pip to install a package and its dependencies.
2. Create a setup.py file for a Python package.
## Day 12: Web Development with Flask

1. Create a Flask app that displays "Hello, World!" when accessed.
2. Create a Flask app that takes in a name parameter and displays "Hello, [name]!" when accessed.
## Day 13: RESTful APIs

1. Create a Flask app that serves as a RESTful API for a resource (such as books or movies).
2. Use the requests library to access a RESTful API and display its data.
## Day 14: Database Integration

1. Use SQLAlchemy to create a table in a SQL database.
2. Write a program that adds data to the table and then reads and displays the data.
## Day 15: Network Programming

1. Write a program that creates a client and a server that can communicate with each other.
2. Use the requests library to access a website and retrieve its data.
## Day 16: Web Scraping

1. Use BeautifulSoup to scrape data from a website and display it.
2. Use Scrapy to scrape data from multiple pages on a website and store it in a file.
## Day 17: Data Analysis and Visualization

1. Use pandas to read in a CSV file and perform basic data analysis on it.
2. Use matplotlib to create a line plot or scatter plot of the data.
## Day 18: Machine Learning

1. Use scikit-learn to create a machine learning model (such as linear regression or k-nearest neighbors).
2. Train the model on a dataset and use it to make predictions.
## Day 19: Automation and Scripting

1. Write a script that automates a repetitive task, such as renaming files or downloading data from a website.
2. Use the subprocess module to run a command-line program from within a Python script.
## Day 20: Cloud Computing

1. Use the boto3 library to interact with an Amazon Web Services (AWS) resource, such as an EC2 instance or an S3 bucket.
2. Use the Google Cloud Storage API to interact with a Google Cloud Storage bucket.
## Day 21: DevOps Tools Integration

1. Use a Python script to interact with a DevOps tool such as Docker, Kubernetes, or Ansible.
2. Use a Python script to automate the deployment of an application using a DevOps tool.

These practice assignments should help you build practical skills in Python for DevOps. 
Good luck and happy coding!
